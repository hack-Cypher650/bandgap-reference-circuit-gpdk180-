# bgr-biased-differential-amplifier-gpdk180-
This project presents the design of a BJT-based bandgap reference and its reuse as an on-chip bias source for a self-biased MOS differential amplifier in gpdk180. The focus is on bias stability, startup behavior, PSRR, and headroom analysis rather than aggressive performance optimization. All circuits were designed and simulated in Cadence Virtuoso
