# bgr-biased-differential-amplifier-gpdk180-
This repository documents a two-part analog design project implemented in gpdk180 using Cadence Virtuoso.

## Part 1 
  Focuses on the design of a parasitic-BJT-based bandgap reference, including startup circuitry, temperature behavior, PSRR, and supply headroom analysis.
## Part 2
  Demonstrates the reuse of this bandgap reference as the bias source for a self-biased MOS differential amplifier employing a Wilson current mirror to improve tail current output resistance and CMRR.

The objective of this project is to study analog biasing fundamentals and system-level integration rather than to achieve production-grade precision.
